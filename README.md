## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Wanting to quickly send some reference signals for your own control system in ROS2? Then this repo's for you. **reference_signal_generator** allows you to quickly bind a ROS2 node to a user-specified topic, and publish a reference signal with any number of inputs and a series of different signal types. The parameters are customized through ROS2 service calls.

You may call the services in many different ways, but this package comes with an extra: a custom [Foxglove](https://foxglove.dev/) panel made specifically for it! Check out [foxglove-reference-signal](https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp/foxglove-reference-signal) now for more information!

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
This repo is a standard ROS2 package (ament_python) that depends on custom service definitions.

### üõ† Prerequisites

- A ROS2 workspace (colcon)
    - See [this tutorial](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html) to learn how to create your own workspace.

- [reference_signal_srvs](https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp/reference_signal_srvs)
    - This [other repo](https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp/reference_signal_srvs) contains the service definitions for the reference signals advertised by **reference_signal_generator**. Definitions are kept in a dedicated package following the ROS2 [best practice](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Single-Package-Define-And-Use-Interface.html).

### üíª Installing

As mentioned above, this repo is a standard ROS2 package. Thus, you simply have to clone it inside your workspace's **src** directory.

```bash
cd <path_to_your_ros2_ws>/src
git clone https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp/reference_signal_generator.git
```

Don't forget to also clone the required [reference_signal_srvs](https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp/reference_signal_srvs) package!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp/reference_signal_srvs.git
```

Then, use **colcon** to build.

```bash
cd <path_to_your_ros2_ws>
colcon build --symlink-install
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Each instance of **reference_signal_generator** binds to a user-specified topic and creates multiple services for starting and stopping several different types of reference signals. Default topic name is **/reference_signal** and user can specify through command-line as follows:

```bash
ros2 run reference_signal_generator reference_signal_generator --ros-args -p topic_name:=<your_topic_name>
```

After starting the generator node, two services will be created to start and stop the reference signals. Use ``ros2 topic list`` to check them out. You must see:

- ``/<your_topic_name>/start`` Used to parameterize and start the reference signal
- ``/<your_topic_name>/stop`` Used to stop a signal created by a ``start`` before its *total_time*

See [reference_signal_srvs](https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp/reference_signal_srvs) for more details on each type of reference signal. Currently supported types are Step, Ramp, Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth and Chirp.
